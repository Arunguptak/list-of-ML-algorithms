What is Machine Learning?
Machine Learning (ML) is defined as a set of computer algorithms that makes systems autonomously learn and yield outputs and further improve from various analysis and outputs.
Machine Learning algorithms can be used to solve business problems like Regression, Classification, Forecasting, Clustering, and Associations, etc.
And if you have heard these terms below, you will be able to segregate all these terms into their respective categories (for an interview or otherwise).
The important thing to understand is that the algorithms weâ€™re learning today, or those that are used in MNCs worldwide in the present-day are actually quite old.

The main set of classification algorithms were developed in the early 1950s.

Even modern deep learning technology that we learn (for example recurrent neural networks) were created in mid-1960s by soviet mathematicians.

Why am I telling you this? Because we should be humble in our learning process.
